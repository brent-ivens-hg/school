## 5. Deliver the Right Message on Google Display Ads

> Ad formats play a vital role in how your brand communicates with your audience. With Google Display ads, you can
> choose from different ad formats based on your priorities — whether it's maximizing efficiency or retaining creative
> control.

### **Why Choose Display Ad Formats?**

Display ads help promote your business across various digital environments, including websites, YouTube, and apps.
Depending on your goals, you can:

- Use **Responsive Display Ads (RDAs)** for automation, performance, and reach
- Opt for **Uploaded Ads** to maintain full creative control over how your ads appear

###     Meet Hiroko

Hiroko, a digital marketing manager at *Your Adventure*, is exploring her ad format options to support her campaigns.
Her choice will depend on whether she prioritizes:

- **Efficiency**: For performance-driven campaigns, RDAs are ideal
- **Control**: For precise branding, uploaded ads might be the better option

### What Are RDAs?

Responsive Display Ads are the default ad type for Google Display campaigns. They use your uploaded assets (e.g.,
images, videos, headlines) to automatically create ads that adapt to any ad space, offering seamless integration into
both native and non-native inventory.

### Key Benefits of RDAs

1. **Automation**: Google uses machine learning to assemble and optimize ads for every placement, maximizing performance and reach
2. **Reach**: RDAs automatically adjust size, appearance, and format to fit almost any ad slot, significantly expanding your
   potential audience
3. **Simplicity**: RDAs reduce time spent managing ad portfolios, freeing you to focus on improving campaign performance
4. **Creative Testing**: Google conducts billions of creative **A/B tests** to ensure your ads deliver the right message to the right user,
   improving engagement and conversions
5. **Proven Performance**: Advertisers see an average of 50% more conversions at a comparable CPA when adding RDAs to their campaigns

### What are Uploaded Ads?

Uploaded ads provide complete control over the look and feel of your campaigns. You create ads outside of Google Ads
and upload them to your Display campaign.

### Types of Uploaded Ads

1. **Image Ads**:
    - Created in tools like Google Web Designer and uploaded as .zip files.
    - Limited to banner-eligible slots, offering less scale compared to RDAs.
    - **Key Benefit**: Full creative control to design ads that match your brand’s vision.

2. **AMPHTML Ads**:
    - Built using AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) principles for faster, lighter, and more secure ad experiences.
    - **Key Benefits**:
        - **Speed**: Ads are six times faster on AMP¹ pages, boosting viewability and effectiveness.
        - **Efficiency**: Three times lighter, ensuring smoother user experiences.
        - **Security**: Validation requirements reduce the risk of malware, enhancing trust in your brand.

¹ *AMP is a web component framework to easily create user-first experiences for the web*

### Best Practices

- Combine **Responsive Display Ads** and **uploaded ads** to maximize reach and control.
- Use RDAs for dynamic, broad-reaching campaigns, and supplement with uploaded ads for specific branding needs.

### Best Practices for Using Performance Planner

      budget is allocated effectively to each objective.
2. **Use Non-Last Click Conversions for Budget Allocation**:
    - By default, Performance Planner forecasts based on conversions listed in the "Conversions" column. For better
      budget allocation, use non-last click conversions to account for the full customer journey.

      regularly to ensure that your plan is aligned with current data.

   CSV format.
2. **Manual Implementation**: Apply the changes directly in Google Ads or upload them using **Google Ads Editor** for
   bulk management.

### Performance Planner Best Practices

- **Use Non-Last Click Attribution**: This ensures you capture the full customer journey in your budget allocation.
- **Separate Plans for Different Marketing Goals**: Group campaigns based on objectives, such as brand awareness or
  direct conversions.
- **Use Performance Targets**: Monitor progress against your goals and receive alerts if performance isn’t meeting
  expectations.
- **Optimize with Recommendations**: Keep an eye on the **optimization score** in the **Recommendations** page to ensure
  your campaigns stay within budget and are not limited.
